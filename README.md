dotfiles
========

Useful configurations for: bash, git etc.

Installation
============

Run the following in your terminal:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/bin; pushd ~/bin; git clone https://github.com/woodyrew/dotfiles.git; ~/bin/dotfiles/installation/install.sh; popd;
```

This will create a new directory in your home folder, clone this repository then run the install script.

Read the [pushd and popd explaination](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushd_and_popd) if you're not sure what that does - remembers the directory you were in.

Enjoy.
